# binglide-ng

This branch is used to work on the next version of binglide. Documentation and
the README will be updated in the future to match and exceed the quality of the
current master branch. When it's ready this will get pushed to master and the
old version will be hidden in some dusty branch.

## Upcoming Features

* multiprocessing
* huge files & streaming
* separation of computation & representation
* better GUI
